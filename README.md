# About This Project
### Thank you for visiting my GitHub repository for our collaborative ___library management system___ maven project. My team of four created this system for a school project, and it features a MySQL database to manage library collections.

The library management system allows users to register, login, borrow, and search for books from the library's database. I also incorporated a public library REST API to enable users to search for books and make requests directly from the library.

While I have not yet implemented OpenCV to read text with a webcam, I am planning to include this feature in the future to make the book registration process even more efficient.

I appreciate your interest in our project and welcome any feedback or contributions. Thank you for taking the time to explore our library management system!
