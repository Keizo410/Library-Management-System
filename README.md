# About This Project
### Thank you for visiting my GitHub repository for our collaborative ___library management system___ project. Our team of four created this system for a school project, and it features a MySQL database to manage library collections.

The library management system allows users to register, login, borrow, and search for books from the library's database. We also incorporated a public library REST API to enable users to search for books and make requests directly from the library.

While we have not yet implemented OpenCV to read text with a webcam, we plan to include this feature in the future to make the book registration process even more efficient.

We appreciate your interest in our project and welcome any feedback or contributions. Thank you for taking the time to explore our library management system!
